Class activation mapping is a phenomenon in which
we only trained a classifier to discriminate between a picture of an apple and an orange.  But we can look at the weights of
its dense layer to determine where exactly in the image the apple or orange is.
Class Activation Mapping was introduced in "Learning Deep Features for Discriminative Localization" by MIT researchers:
Bolei Zhou, Aditya Khosla, Agata Lapedriza, Aude Oliva, Antonio Torralba.
